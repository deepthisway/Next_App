  const workHistory = `• 2017 to 2018 Postdoctoral Research Fellow Medical College of Wisconsin – Milwaukee, WI
• Conducted experimental and computational research on an MR-Linac medical linear accelerator to pinpoint the instrument design effect on the dose distribution
• Took part in experiments to identify the effects of the source-to-axis distance difference between an MR-Linac and a conventional Linac
• Generated 3D and IMRT dose plans with Monaco workstation
• Received machine quality assurance and safety training on conventional Linacs
• Calibrated and operated radiation detection instruments
• Authored professional scientific papers for publishing in peer-reviewed journals
• Explored data to discover patterns, meaningful relationships, anomalies, and trends
• Gained knowledge of radiation safety procedures, standards
• 2010 to 2017 Research & Teaching Assistant Temple University – Philadelphia, PA, USA
• Designed and carried out laser spectroscopy experiments such as optical-optical double resonance and Autler-Townes splitting experiments.
• Gained extensive experience in operating, and troubleshooting various types of lasers such as tunable single longitudinal mode ring dye and Ti: Sapphire lasers, and their Diode, Argon-Ion pump lasers, Fourier Transform Interferometer (FTIR), and double grating spectrometer (SPEX 1404).`;
